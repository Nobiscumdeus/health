<p>
  Think of it as an app where students in a class can create their details, read the details of others and also update details with their password.
</p>
<p> The application was also developed with some authentication measures in mind , for instance certain quiz must be all passed correctly to prevent a non-member of the class to have access to the class page. </p>
